Setup Instructions: Created a root folder and run php in a web folder you create within the root folder. You will also need composer/twig to run this application. You can see I created a composer.json file within my root folder. You will need this to install composer. After downloading composer simply run a composer install command in your terminal in the root folder.

Program Description: I created a simple Contact List creator. The user can input a Name, Phone Number, Address and a link to an image of the contact and it will display a nice formatted list of the information the user inputs. You can also delete this list if you choose to do so.
